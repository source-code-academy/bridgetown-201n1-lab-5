1. Write a function called sum() - DONE

4. where the first element is the sum of those numbers - DONE
5. and the second element is a concatenated string that EXACTLY follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function:

"The sum of 4 and 7 is 11."

Test this function by hand in the console to get it working, and when you think it is finished, uncomment the call for the testSum() function below and check the console to see if the test passes.*/

/* Problem 3
Write a function called sumAndMultiply() that takes in three numbers as separate arguments and returns an array
 where the first element is the sum of those three numbers, t
 he second element is the product of those three numbers,

Third element: "4 and 7 and 5 sum to 16."
Fourth element: "The product of 4 and 7 and 5 is 140."

IMPORTANT DETAIL: You may not use the arithmetic operators + and * in this function. To do addition, use your sum() function, and to do multiplication, use your multiply() function that you've already created. You're going to have to be resourceful to figure out how to do this. However, you may continue to use the + operator for string concatenation.
